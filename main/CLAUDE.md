# collection agent

This is an AR collection agent app that basically has a table of like customers and their invoice statuses, and then lets you spawn or lets you do a call to the customers and then it has the transcript of that shit live. It's like Convex. It uses Convex as the backend. It's for a YC AI agents hackathon, and it's important that it really showcases the Convex reactive functionality. Yeah, we kind of just want it to be really visible and shit. God bless you Claude.

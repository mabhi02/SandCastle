# collection agent

We're building an AI agent that automatically collects overdue invoices for businesses - it calls customers, negotiates payment terms, sends payment links, and processes the money, turning "overdue" into "paid" without human intervention. Every Friday, instead of founders and finance teams spending hours chasing payments, our agent handles the entire collection process while they focus on growing their business. This isn't a tool to help AR clerks work faster - it completely replaces the AR clerk, handling everything from the first call to the final payment. The vision is that no business should ever have to manually chase an invoice again.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

- this is for a hackathon that is shipping in literally 3 hours.
- please check if things compile via convex and build in nextjs as testing after any of your changes. really important that both of these work.
